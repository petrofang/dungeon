Dungeon: A multi-user game written in Python

Description:
    This started as a small project for an Intro-to-Python class before 
    evolving into something actually playable. Is it even playable now?
    You'll have to decide for yourself. The code is documented and 
    commented to a reasonable extent, but there is ample room for
    improvement as well.
    
Installation:
    The game runs directly from the python source code, so you will need
    Python 3 to run it. The database runs on SQLite which shoud be included
    with Python. Run "main.py" to enter the main game loop. You can then 
    connect via Telnet or your favorite MUD client. By default, the 
    connection IP will be 127.0.0.1 port 4000
